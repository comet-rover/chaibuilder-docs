title: Chai Data Providers
description: Chai Data Providers are the fundamental components of the Chai Builder, serving as the core elements for Chai Builder Apps.
---

Chai Data providers are async functions that return data to Chai Builder.
Builder uses this data to bind UI element and render the pages.

This is especially useful when you want to fetch data from an external source like headless CMS or local file system.
User first needs to [register the data provider](/data-providers/registering-data-providers) and then bind the data to the UI elements in builder.

:::note
Chai Data Providers are optional. User can always add static content to pages inside builder.
